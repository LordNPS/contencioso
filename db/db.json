I had to ask several times I I was done because the security people simply walked away from me without a word. Later that day a woman left the security area under the belief that she was finished. The security folks claimed she had not finished and had somehow fled the security area early. In reality the Frankfurt security staff was very poor about how they communicated to passengers as to what to do and when they were finished. They closed down the airport to search for her and this caused all the planes to be delayed 5 hours. WOW airlines finally got us to Keflavik but we had missed the connecting flights. WOW was very disorganized and they were massively unclear and caused much confusion with the following areas; 1) how to get routed to the buses that would take us to the hotel 2) where we would be staying (in Keflavik or Reykjavik?) 3) how to get our food at the restaurant they took us to for dinner 4) Whether and where Breakfast and lunches were arranged 5) When buses would be taking us from the hotel to the airport.

This caused small delay and discomfort. After checking in, all was fine, and pilot already said there could be problem for landing to SPU airport due to bad weather but headed to Split anyway. After 2 tries, he continued taxing in air for next 1.45 minutes over area, or more (instead of landing at closest airport Zadar, only 1.5 hours away by car from Split). After 1.45 minutes taxing over area, he decided to go to Zagreb (4 hours = 400 km distance). Then they kept us in plain for one hour more (against our will) waiting to get instructions from management. They didn't wanted to let us out in Zagreb. Toilets were occupied all time, plane was full, air was used, and people started to be quite nervous. After one hour waiting (approximately around 23.00h) captain informed us they will go again in Split, unsure about weather conditions, try to land again, and if landing is not successful they will return us back in MILANO ITALY. After 5 minutes he announced change of plans, saying that they will go back to UK if landing is not successful. Since this was completely out of question for our family (my kids were having school in the morning), we decided to leave the plane immediately, and to call local authorities if needed, since staff didn't wanted to let us out. After some time trying to convince us to stay, we told them we will call police, since in Croatia they are not allowed to keep us against our will to stay. We decided to definitely disembark in Zagreb and to seek public transportation to return back home. We couldnt take risk to go back in UK or in Milano ITALY, especially since there are much closer airports here. At the end, they didn't wanted to let us out before finding our baggage, not willing to transport them to Split (although we paid a ticket for this!), and it took us another precious one hour. They even stayed physically in-front of open doors, just that we cannot go out! Finally they have found our luggage already after midnight so we spent more than 6 hours in plane instead of 2- 2,5h.

Expenses are about 100 Euro covering four taxis and food until i came to Iceland.","cancellationNotice":"no notice or less than 3 days before","offerAlternative":"First the airline tried to put me on another plane the morning after so i had to be at the airport 6:30 but the ticket was a jump ticket and there were no seats available so i had to go back to the ticket office to get another ticket home. Then the airline got me on a plane to Amsterdam (14:30) and from there late next night (22:35)from Amsterdam to Keflavik. I could not get back until more than 1 day after i was supposed to be back. They got me a hotel room at the holiday inn and a voucher for food there but it was so late that the kitchen was closed and nothing to eat but old pasta and i only got one voucher that the hotel took when i ate the pasta so there was no food the day after. The airline did not pay for the taxi to and from the hotel and there were four trips to and from the hotel. They said that the captain got sick so they canceled all the flights to Iceland the whole weekend, i find that strange that they do not get another captain to take the rest of the flights.","voluntary":"","timestamp":"02Sep 15h02","empty2":"","airlineClaimDate":"","airlineClaimHandler":"","airlineClaimAck":"","empty3":"","empty4":"","empty5":"","empty6":"","empty7":"","empty8":"","empty9":"","empty10":"","empty11":"","empty12":"","empty13":"","empty14":"","empty15":"","empty16":"","empty17":"","empty18":"","empty19":"","empty20":"","empty21":"","empty22":"","empty23":""},{"aireclaimID":"5980","empty1":"","handler":"f","claimValue":"2x400","passengerMain":"yassine","adultNumber":"2","childrenNumber":"","comentarios":"emails vieram devolvidos","emailMain":"yassinesbaiti@holj.be","emailExtras":"ffkd@hndd.de","airlineName":"hella airlines","flightRef":"hl3558","flightDate":"2016/08/30","flightOrigin":"athene","flightDestination":"amsterdam","typeClaim":"3h","connectedFlight":"","booking":"","text":"i dont know","cancellationNotice":"","offerAlternative":"","voluntary":"","timestamp":"02Sep 12h15","empty2":"","airlineClaimDate":"","airlineClaimHandler":"","airlineClaimAck":"","empty3":"","empty4":"","empty5":"","empty6":"","empty7":"","empty8":"","empty9":"","empty10":"","empty11":"","empty12":"","empty13":"","empty14":"","empty15":"","empty16":"","empty17":"","empty18":"","empty19":"","empty20":"","empty21":"","empty22":"","empty23":""},{"aireclaimID":"5978","empty1":"","handler":"JCe","claimValue":"250","passengerMain":"Nuno Moreira","adultNumber":"1","childrenNumber":"","comentarios":"","emailMain":"Nuno.dacosta.moreira@gmail.com","emailExtras":"","airlineName":"Lufthansa","flightRef":"Lh1370","flightDate":"2016/07/22","flightOrigin":"Frankfurt","flightDestination":"Krakow","typeClaim":"canc","connectedFlight":"","booking":"","text":"","cancellationNotice":"no notice or less than 3 days before","offerAlternative":"No. Airport closed","voluntary":"","timestamp":"02Sep 12h12","empty2":"","airlineClaimDate":"","airlineClaimHandler":"","airlineClaimAck":"","empty3":"","empty4":"","empty5":"","empty6":"","empty7":"","empty8":"","empty9":"","empty10":"","empty11":"","empty12":"","empty13":"","empty14":"","empty15":"","empty16":"","empty17":"","empty18":"","empty19":"","empty20":"","empty21":"","empty22":"","empty23":""},{"aireclaimID":"5975","empty1":"","handler":"JCe","claimValue":"3x600","passengerMain":"Ana Sofia Abel Alves","adultNumber":"2","childrenNumber":"1","comentarios":"","emailMain":"sofiaalves@biofisa.com","emailExtras":"Use the same e-mail - sofiaalves@biofisa.com","airlineName":"ORBEST","flightRef":"ORB876","flightDate":"2016/08/27","flightOrigin":"Varadero","flightDestination":"Lisbon","typeClaim":"3h","connectedFlight":"","booking":"","text":"Hi, I would like to claim a flight delayed, it was supposed to depart from Varadero on August 27th at 11:35pm and the we just depart at 3:45am on August 28th.

The only \\'compensation\\' that we were given, during the whole delay, was a â‚¬5 voucher which was not enough to cover \\'breakfast\\', since only a coffee and a pastry were over â‚ ¬7. Additionally, everybody was told that they would receive this voucher every two hours, but this did not happen; and when the second voucher was called, not many people heard, then when had asked about it we were told it was too late to redeem this second voucher.

Em nenhum momento deste processo foi apresentada quaisquer justificaÃ§Ã£o ou informaÃ§Ã£o concernente ao atraso verificado. O referido voo foi adiado sucessivamente desde as 17h25m (hora inicialmente prevista) atÃ© Ã s 23h30m, hora de embarque no Aeroporto de Malta. Para operacionalizar esta exposiÃ§Ã£o de forma concisa, precisa e sucinta, passo a elencar alguns factos que considero deveras prementes para uma anÃ¡lise cuidada e assertiva. Adquiri um pacote de fÃ©rias, no qual estavam incluÃ­dos quer as viagens de ida (09/08) e regresso (16/08), (Porto/Malta/Porto, com escala em Lisboa), em regime de TI (tudo incluÃ­do), num Hotel de 4 estrelas, em que os transferes de e para o aeroporto tambÃ©m estavam contemplados. No dia de chegada a Malta, o representante local da Sonhando (da Oswald Arrigo Limited Travel & Tourism), informou-nos da hora de saÃ­da do hotel para o aeroporto no dia de regresso a Portugal (16/08) que se iria observar Ã s 14h 40. No referido dia aguardei com o meu marido no lobby do hotel durante mais de uma hora, sem termos sido contactados por nenhum profissional da equipa do Operador TurÃ­stico Sonhando. Contudo e jÃ¡ perto das 16h00 e atravÃ©s de outros passageiros portugueses que tambÃ©m se encontravam hospedados na mesma unidade hoteleira e que fariam o mesmo voo de regresso, tivemos conhecimento que o transfer foi alterado para as 16.40h, pois o voo estava atrasado. Esse horÃ¡rio tambÃ©m nÃ£o foi cumprido e o transporte sÃ³ se verificou com mais de 30 minutos de atraso. Acresce que, com todas estas alteraÃ§Ãµes permanecemos no mesmo local durante todo esse tempo com receio de perdermos o transfer. O condutor do autocarro que realizou o transporte deixou-nos na entrada do aeroporto sem apresentar qualquer informaÃ§Ã£o adicional. No aeroporto existia a indicaÃ§Ã£o de \\\"delay\\\" do voo, sem balcÃ£o para check-in identificado e sem gate de embarque. Aguardamos na Ã¡rea pÃºblica e de restauraÃ§Ã£o, atentos aos quadros que em nenhum momento sofreram alteraÃ§Ãµes. em determinado momento, um elemento de uma famÃ­lia que aguardava no mesmo local, informou-nos que jÃ¡ tinham efectuado o check-in e que o balcÃ£o jÃ¡ havia encerrado. DeslocÃ¡mo-nos entÃ£o ao guichÃ© de informaÃ§Ãµes, que nos indicaram um outro balcÃ£o para o efeito onde jÃ¡ aguardavam outros Portugueses ( 2 deles com viagens adquiridas e cujos nomes nÃ£o se encontravam na lista de passageiros). Quando foi possÃ­vel efectuar o check-in, jÃ¡ nÃ£o haviam lugares contÃ­guos no voo, pelo que tive de vir sentada em lugar que distava do meu marido. Questionada a profissional do dito balcÃ£o nÃ£o soube apresentar mais informaÃ§Ãµes, a nÃ£o ser a constataÃ§Ã£o mais uma vez que o voo se encontrava atrasado. A partir desse momento nos placards foi sendo apenas postada a informaÃ§Ã£o de que o voo estava atrasado e as horas prevista de descolagem de Malta. Inicialmente para as 20h00, depois para as 21h00 e finalmente para as 23h30. A ausÃªncia de informaÃ§Ã£o foi uma constante, mesmo quando solicitada junto dos balcÃµes das informaÃ§Ãµes e apoio ao cliente. Continuavam a constatar o Ã³bvio- o atraso, sendo que acabamos por embarcar e depois levantar voo cerca das 23h 45 minutos. A hora prevista de chegada ao Porto (21h15) acabou por ser consideravelmente mais tardia (3h26). De notar tambÃ©m que dado o horÃ¡rio adiantado, o tempo de recolha de bagagens tambÃ©m foi aumentado e justificado pelos profissionais do aeroporto, pelo nÃºmero mais reduzido de profissionais para essa actividade. Esta situaÃ§Ã£o acarretou para alÃ©m de todo o desconforto e inseguranÃ§a jÃ¡ sentidos em Malta, um sentimento de total desinteresse pelos clientes, visto que na chegada ao aeroporto, nÃ£o se encontrava nenhum elemento da equipa com quem subscrevemos o referido pacote de viagem, que pudesse colmatar pelo menos do ponto de vista da justificaÃ§Ã£o/informaÃ§Ã£o do atraso observado. Para agravamento da situaÃ§Ã£o, o transporte para o respectivo domicÃ­lio tambÃ©m foi constrangedor, visto que o plano delineado na programaÃ§Ã£o das fÃ©rias teve que ser obrigatoriamente redefinido. Como nÃ£o possuÃ­amos transporte pessoal e no exterior nÃ£o existiam TÃ¡xis disponÃ­veis, tivemos que solicitar um tÃ¡xi pelo qual ainda aguardamos algum tempo. Chegamos a casa (PaÃ§os de Ferreira) jÃ¡ muito perto das 5h do dia 17/08/2016.","cancellationNotice":"","offerAlternative":"","voluntary":"","timestamp":"27Aug 02h06","empty2":"","airlineClaimDate":"","airlineClaimHandler":"","airlineClaimAck":"","empty3":"","empty4":"","empty5":"","empty6":"","empty7":"","empty8":"","empty9":"","empty10":"","empty11":"","empty12":"","empty13":"","empty14":"","empty15":"","empty16":"","empty17":"","empty18":"","empty19":"","empty20":"","empty21":"","empty22":"","empty23":""},{"aireclaimID":"5766","empty1":"","handler":"Fe","claimValue":"250","passengerMain":"Matej Matuscak","adultNumber":"1","childrenNumber":"","comentarios":"pedi booking nº 25 set","emailMain":"matejmatuscak1998@gmail.com","emailExtras":"","airlineName":"Ryanair","flightRef":"FR2319","flightDate":"2016/01/06","flightOrigin":"Bratislava","flightDestination":"London Stansted","typeClaim":"3h","connectedFlight":"","booking":"","text":"","cancellationNotice":"","offerAlternative":"","voluntary":"","timestamp":"26Aug 03h31","empty2":"","airlineClaimDate":"","airlineClaimHandler":"","airlineClaimAck":"","empty3":"","empty4":"","empty5":"","empty6":"","empty7":"","empty8":"","empty9":"","empty10":"","empty11":"","empty12":"","empty13":"","empty14":"","empty15":"","empty16":"","empty17":"","empty18":"","empty19":"","empty20":"","empty21":"","empty22":"","empty23":""},{"aireclaimID":"5765","empty1":"","handler":"Fe","claimValue":"3x250","passengerMain":"Sofia Amorim","adultNumber":"2","childrenNumber":"1","comentarios":"novo email encontra o historico. basta pesquisar em all mailboxes","emailMain":"trad.sofia@gmail.com","emailExtras":"trad.sofia@gmail.com","airlineName":"aireuropa","flightRef":"UX7532","flightDate":"30-07-2016","flightOrigin":"Palma de Mallorca","flightDestination":"Santiago","typeClaim":"","connectedFlight":"","booking":"","text":"Viajei com a minha familia de Santiago para Palma de Mallorca com Air Europa () no dia 23/07, sofremos um atraso de 16 horas.

Este Ãºltimo percurso estava com partida prevista Ã s 17h45 e chegada a Lisboa Ã s 21:10 do dia 17 de Agosto 2016. ReferÃªncia da reserva: 7UM3PW. O aviÃ£o que iria fazer o percurso Horta-Lisboa nÃ£o aterrou e divergiu para a ilha Terceira, alegadamente por mÃ¡s condiÃ§Ãµes climatÃ©ricas, embora estivessem a ser operados voos da SATA Air AÃ§ores na mesma altura no aeroporto da Horta. ApÃ³s ~2h55 de espera com anÃºncios de atrasos, anunciaram finalmente por altifalante o cancelamento do voo. Durante esse perÃ­odo, nÃ£o foram servidas refeiÃ§Ãµes/bebidas aos passageiros que estavam no aeroporto Ã espera. Uma vez que o reencaminhamento implicou a pernoita na Horta, deveria ter-me sido providenciado alojamento pela companhia aÃ©rea. Contudo, os colaboradores da SATA informaram-nos de que nÃ£o havia alojamento disponÃ­vel para todos os passageiros. Por esse motivo, tive de recorrer a familiares para pernoitar na casa deles. Esta e outras situaÃ§Ãµes relacionadas com o cancelamento foram notÃ­cia: http://www.rtp.pt/play/p56/e247127/telejornal-acores (vide minutos 06:13-13:20). A companhia ofereceu-me as viagens de tÃ¡xi de ida/volta entre o aeroporto e a casa particular onde pernoitei. O voucher que me ofereceram para o jantar no dia 17 nÃ£o foi utilizado porque (i) o restaurante do aeroporto jÃ¡ estava fechado e (ii) nÃ£o hÃ¡ restaurantes nas redondezas da casa onde pernoitei, ficando essa refeiÃ§Ã£o a cargo da minha famÃ­lia. Depois de assistir Ã reportagem com o porta-voz da SATA, fiquei entÃ£o a saber que a falta de certificaÃ§Ã£o dos pilotos para aterrar na Horta Ã noite foi tambÃ©m motivo para o cancelamento do voo, uma circunstÃ¢ncia que entendo nÃ£o ser extraordinÃ¡ria/alheia Ã companhia aÃ©rea. TambÃ©m entendo que nÃ£o foram tomadas todas as medidas razoÃ¡veis nesta situaÃ§Ã£o, nomeadamente: encaminhamento dos passageiros que iam fazer a ligaÃ§Ã£o Horta-Lisboa para a Terceira pela SATA Air AÃ§ores, para entÃ£o apanharem o voo da SATA International para Lisboa; ou divergÃªncia do aviÃ£o para o Pico em vez da Terceira, sendo os passageiros transportados da Horta para essa ilha vizinha por via marÃ­tima para entÃ£o apanharem o voo para Lisboa, como jÃ¡ sucedera noutras ocasiÃµes.

We were informed at around 21:30 that there would be about an hour delay and so at 00:30 we were boarded onto the aeroplane. Instead of us departing from the airport we were driven around the airport in the aeroplane until 01:30 a.m. where it was announced to us that there was a technical problem and the flight would be postponed for another 20 minutes. However, they could not fly us out as the pilots had already done their shift and we were told we had to wait in the airport till further notice. After couple of hours somebody finally came to inform us that we need to stay at the airport or go and stay somewhere else, if we have a place to go because our flight was scheduled for Sunday, 11:30a.m. Again with another delay we eventually boarded at 12:15 noon. There was no special care or concern about any of the passengers, we were just left at the gate till boarding time. There were no blankets provided to us since it was extremely cold at the gate we were left, only refreshment vouchers for very little drinks and only snacks were allowed-, no proper meal.. We shouldâ€™ve been offered accommodation till our next given flight or offered at least somewhere to freshen up. We were left unsatisfied and extremely upset inside the gate of the airport and extremely worried concerned when we would arrive safely back home.

My flight to Riga should be on time 13:10, gates closing around 12:40 so I had plenty of time for coffee and last phone conversations.

And lady at desk said that my flight is delayed till 16:30, when I asked why she said that she dont know and I can get food vaucher on 3Â£. Luton airport is so expensive that there is nothing to buy for 3Â£. So I took vaucher and sat on bench next to telly and started to wait for 16:30. Around 16:35 gates was open and I went to the gates. Borded around 17:00 and plane left at 17:30. In Riga I was at 22:00 and I missed bus to my hometown, which is 230 km from Riga. Last bus to my hometown leaves Riga at 17 :10. If flight would be on time I could get last bus and get to home normaly like I always do. But this time there were no buses and I was in a middle of airport with no chances to get home. I gave call to one of my friends and he arrieved to airport to pick me up.

We arrived 3 hours earlier at the airport to make sure everything will be smooth. Upon check-in, I noticed that they have written on the screen \\\"ETA 1:00, Aug 1\\\" and asked them to correct it, because we are flying on the 31st of July. To my horror, they told me that the flight will be delayed by more than 9 hours. I asked for an explanation and they told me that this delay was accumulated over the course of a few days and they were not able to catch up. So they knew that there will be a huge delay but could not be bothered to inform us by email in advance (they do have all email addresses of passengers who bought tickets online via their web site). No passenger at the baggage dropoff queue seemed to know in advance that there will be a delay! As a result, we were forced to be stranded at the airport for 9 hours. It was a miserable experience. There were sick children vomiting all over the gate. People sleeping on the floor. The airline provided food and drinks as required by law. However, they refused to provide the most important thing we need: INFORMATION. All they said was that we are waiting for an aircraft to arrive from PRG. I challenged them multiple times and they couldn\\'t answer my simple question: has the aircraft left the PRG airport - yes or no? (With some research I found that the aircraft we are waiting for is in fact QS 1178). At this point we thought that they are trying to cover up something very serious. I discovered at least 3 flights to PRG operated by the same airline. They all departed to PRG while we were stranded. Information desk confirmed seat availability. I immediately challenged representatives and demanded to be transferred to these flights free of charge. Their responses: \\\"These are charter flights, we are not allowed to transfer you to charters\\\" \\\"You need to buy tickets, your baggage to be transferred, it\\'s a lot of work\\\". Nonsense. The estimated time of departure moved from 01:00 to 02:00 and when the deadline was missed once again - to 04:00. We departed at 04:30 am in what most of us perceived as a miracle. Precisely 12 hours after the regular time (16:30).

Not long after I have purchased new tickets I received info at the airport that our Sunday flight will be delayed for Monday morning and cost of overnight, taxes etc. will be covered by WizzAir, with no option of exchanging ticket for a new date (flight). The reason for my claim is unnecessary cost occurred for a new tickets (total 1,615 SEK), and were purchased because of wrong info given to us at the airport. Also, I have occurred cost of airport transfer (5,600 DIN) and cost of overnight (another 5,000 DIN) along with one day at work I have missed due to this delay (1,000 SEK).

I really hope I can get any kind of opinion, help and support from you in orde r to get a refund for all the stress and disappointment that has occurred due to such delays and the final cancellation of the flight, and I want to thank you in advance for this.

In Madrid we were denied boarding although we were holding a confirmed reservation and boarding pass, we presented ourselves well in advance before boarding time, we had proper travel documentation and there was not any health/safety/security issue involved. The information we received from Iberia desk in Madridâ€™s airport was that â€œwe did not appear in travelers lists due to a possible computer error in the web system of the companyâ€ (sic). We were offered accommodation, meals and free transportation to and from the hotel and we were boarded in a Madrid â€ Lisbon flight next day (22 April 2016). We filled (me and my daughter) the EU complain form along with photocopied boarding passes and we sent it to the legal department of Iberia on the 28th/04/2016. Iberia emailed us on 31th/05/2016 (Reference: C16051-3421740535) asking us to provide further documents, a request with which we timely complied. Next, Iberia emailed us again on the 24th/06/2016 with the following content: â€œI am writing in relation to flight IB 3118 of 21, April 2016 and would like to take this opportunity to thank you for contacting us. Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience we might have caused you due to the flight delay (IB3151 from Athenas to Madrid). We know how important it is to our passengers that the scheduled time is observed on a trip, and make every effort to achieve this. On this occasion, we were forced to delay the flight due to a fault that our technicians had to repair to ensure the safety of your flight. As it was an extraordinary circumstance that we could not prevent, despite taking all the measures at our disposal, European Community Regulations do not establish any compensationâ€. I am not satisfied with iberiaâ€™s answer since there was never any flight delay (IB31 51 from Athenas to Madrid (21 April 2016) as claimed in iberiaâ€™s mail, neither have we mentioned one in our complain form. Iberiaâ€™s argument is false/imprecise as you can verify checking on the records of either VENIZELOS airport or BARAJAS airport regarding the specific flights on this date. There was no missed connection due to a delay, neither have we claimed one. There was a denied boarding against our will and without any responsibility from our side, as described in the complain form. Iberia failed to provide any argument on the denial of boarding in the IB3118 flight from Madrid to Lisbon, which is the real incident.","timestamp":"18Jul 06h48","empty2":"","airlineClaimDate":"19 Jul","airlineClaimHandler":"jc","airlineClaimAck":"Reclamación cliente_20160719090014612","empty3":"","empty4":"","empty5":"","empty6":"","empty7":"","empty8":"","empty9":"","empty10":"","empty11":"","empty12":"","empty13":"","empty14":"","empty15":"","empty16":"","empty17":"","empty18":"","empty19":"","empty20":"","empty21":"","empty22":"","empty23":""},{"aireclaimID":"5006","empty1":"4929","handler":"f","claimValue":"","passengerMain":"Ricardo Sa","adultNumber":"2","childrenNumber":"1","comentarios":"só isso nao O q dá direito a compens é atraso/cancel/denial q tb da direito a rerouting ou devol 26jul","emailMain":"ricardo.pintocsa@gmail.com","emailExtras":"grodrigues.vnf@gmail.com","airlineName":"Everjet","flightRef":"EVJ937","flightDate":"2016-07-18","flightOrigin":"pxo","flightDestination":"opo","typeClaim":"3h","connectedFlight":"","booking":"","text":"Rerouting","cancellationNotice":"","offerAlternative":"","voluntary":"","timestamp":"17Jul 22h12","empty2":"","airlineClaimDate":"","airlineClaimHandler":"","airlineClaimAck":"","empty3":"","empty4":"","empty5":"","empty6":"","empty7":"","empty8":"","empty9":"","empty10":"","empty11":"","empty12":"","empty13":"","empty14":"","empty15":"","empty16":"","empty17":"","empty18":"","empty19":"","empty20":"","empty21":"","empty22":"","empty23":""},{"aireclaimID":"4925","empty1":"","handler":"Fe","claimValue":"3*250","passengerMain":"Adrian Udrescu","adultNumber":"3","childrenNumber":"","comentarios":"mesmo booking i26jul","emailMain":"adrianudrescu@ymail.com","emailExtras":"morar_vasile53@yahoo.com arnautu.ralucaa@gmail.com","airlineName":"ALITALIA","flightRef":"AZ1480","flightDate":"2016-07-15","flightOrigin":"VENICE MARCO POLO","flightDestination":"ROMA FIUMICINO","typeClaim":"mis","connectedFlight":"AZ502 Operator: Alitalia From: ROME FIUMICINO to BUCHAREST OTOPENI Departure: 15 Jul 21:50 Arrival: 16 Jul 01:00","booking":"8KBKQ6","text":"The flight from Venice to Rome took off with late - 1 hour and we lost the connection, the flight from Rome to Bucharest.

So we had no choice because if we would choose to get hotel from airplain your company could not return the suitcases immediately. We feel imprisoned these 2 hours. So I dont speak about expences that occured directly due to the delay by Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 of the European Parliament. I speak about compensation that occurred directly due to my experience. Just because our airplain was arrived not in Barcelona, that is why I have late for one day to my job, and I lost 12 hours work day one of my work hour cost 15 euro( it is not small money for me).

Second - yes, I have bought something in airport , when the flights was delayed, but I haven't collect any cheques. And third - in the airplain, after delaying for 3 hours , water was selling to the passengers, instead of giving it for free. (I have got video like an evidence) Wizzair offered me 50 euro on my wizzair balance like a compensation - it is not really satisfied me, that is why I am writing to you, possibly you can help me!?

Finally we got the meal voucher,but we had to ask for it. At the end, the flight was at 1 AM, within 27 hours of delay. I lost all the trains and almost a next flight who i had it from Oslo. We asked if it is possible to go somewhere nearby,cause we saw that there was a plane to Kopenhagen or Oslo but they said that is not possible,that we can get money back for the flight and book a new flight by ourselves.

I had already checkin on the night of 27th however I couldn\\'t download my boarding pass. The next morning at the airport about an hour befor the departure time I saw no information against my flight and no one at the check in counters. Assuming that the flight might be delayed I waited for the information to be updated. At 9 am I saw that the boarding has began, I ran at the security to help me print the boading pass since I couldn\\'t find the airlines on any of the kiosk and no one at the check in counters. Without any help from the security per sonnel, I rushed to Lufthansas counter to finally locate the small vueling counter where the lady denied to print my boarding pass after repeated request as I was losing time. Eventually I missed my flight with all this confusion about the delay in flight. After sometime a few others turned up who missed their flight due to the same problem. I was supposed to be in Barcelona for the exhibition Alimentaria where I had few meetings. The losses I had to bear due to this bad client experience are: missed flight, missed important meetings, lost time, payed 50 Euros to get the keys at AirBnB as I reached late in the night, payed for the bus tickets, and the grave inconvinience caused to me.","cancellationNotice":"","offerAlternative":"","voluntary":"","timestamp":"09Jun 01h27","empty2":"","airlineClaimDate":"3 Ago","airlineClaimHandler":"jc","airlineClaimAck":"[SR_Number: 1-6887894420]","empty3":"","empty4":"","empty5":"","empty6":"","empty7":"","empty8":"","empty9":"","empty10":"","empty11":"","empty12":"","empty13":"","empty14":"","empty15":"","empty16":"","empty17":"","empty18":"","empty19":"","empty20":"","empty21":"","empty22":"","empty23":""},{"aireclaimID":"4320","empty1":"","handler":"MCe","claimValue":"3x600","passengerMain":"Susanna Le Roux","adultNumber":"3","childrenNumber":"","comentarios":"","emailMain":"sonjarandhart@gmail.com","emailExtras":"braamnordbak@gmail.com johanth3man@gmail.com ","airlineName":"Air France","flightRef":"AF995","flightDate":"2016-05-29","flightOrigin":"Or Tambo - Johannesburg","flightDestination":"Paris , france","typeClaim":"3h","connectedFlight":"","booking":"","text":"Flight Number AF995 - (Origional) We were suppose to arrive in paris 30 May at 05:25am.

Our flight was scheduled to leave at 14:15 but didnâ€™t leave until 19:55. The reason for the delay was that their plane had skidded off the Birmingham runway at landing. The only announcement that was made was that there would be â€˜further informationâ€™ at 14:00, then at 14:30 and then at 17:00. We were left guessing whether our flight would actually depart, about the reason for the delay and about any possible action that we would have to take. At 17:20 we found out that we would possibly leave around 19:30. It was only through the published online news that we were informed on the actual reason for the delay: their plane skidded off the runway due to a technical fault. And neither in the airport nor on board of the newly chartered plane did we get an official apology and/or explanation by Monarch! According to that afternoonâ€™s news some passengers on the particular aircraft experienced that there was something wrong on take-off. Yet it was decided to go ahead and continue the flight, after which it nearly crashed and caused a long delay for us and our 18 months daughter. It made us arrive at our final destination at 1:30 am! The replacement plane that was then chartered obviously had a different approach to customer service than to what we are used to from Monarch. We were quite frankly bullied by an obviously tired and overworked cabin manager. She needed to project her tiredness and frustration on a couple with a young kid. We found ourselves at the end of the boarding queue instead of the usual beginning. We were then told off for asking for help from the cabin crew in stowing our hand luggage and were literally commanded to sit down, while the window seat was still expecting another passenger, while that seat and mine were filled with all our hand luggage and while I couldnâ€™t sit down because there were people blocking the aisle. She then made it her â€˜jobâ€™ during the flight to keep checking on everything we did or did not do â€ to such an extend that passengers around us were getting uncomfortable with it and started making comments. Itâ€™s simply passive-aggressive power driven behavi our that shows up when people are experiencing some internal stress â€ as I experience throughout a lot of my work with individuals and organizations. I just donâ€™t expect this from someone being put in charge of a sensitive situation. I already wrote to Monarch when we were back from holiday. They took about 6 months and more of my writing to actually send a response, saying that they are not taking responsibility for the delay (all documents from that communication are still available., should you need them). Back then the new EU compensation law was just being introduced and they just tried to get away with it by bullying and dodging techniques. I just heard from a friend that she finally got compensated, so this is my new try.","cancellationNotice":"","offerAlternative":"","voluntary":"","timestamp":"06Jun 19h22","empty2":"","airlineClaimDate":"17Junho","airlineClaimHandler":"F","airlineClaimAck":"email ack","empty3":"","empty4":"","empty5":"","empty6":"","empty7":"","empty8":"","empty9":"","empty10":"","empty11":"","empty12":"","empty13":"","empty14":"","empty15":"","empty16":"","empty17":"","empty18":"","empty19":"","empty20":"","empty21":"","empty22":"","empty23":""},{"aireclaimID":"4292","empty1":"","handler":"Fe","claimValue":"250","passengerMain":"john Keys","adultNumber":"1","childrenNumber":"","comentarios":"","emailMain":"johnmkeys@hotmail.com","emailExtras":"","airlineName":"KLM","flightRef":"KL0963","flightDate":"2016/05/23","flightOrigin":"Amsterdam","flightDestination":"NewCastle","typeClaim":"canc","connectedFlight":"","booking":"","text":"I missed a meeting with an American, I had to arrange a meeting the following week.

Please allow me to further explain myself. I checked in on time for the flight through the Emirates application. Eventually I never received a boarding pass. By the time I realized I couldn't go through the check point I directly proceeded to Emirates Desk to confirm my presence at the airport. The lady on duty was anything but helpful although I insisted on presenting my valid ticket and making clear that it was more than necessary for me to fly due to professional commitments dictating my immediate presence in Athens. This is also demonstrated by the fact that I was travelling Business Class, as flights were fully booked due to hijack the day before. Although I arrived timely and evidently by the airport authorities at the Emirates Desk, the members of staff denied picking me up to board. I hereby note my disappointment with regard to Emirates ground personnel service. The company should have evaluated the situation more effectively provided that professional activity of doctors and lawyers is considered a vocation. As already mentioned, flights being fully booked I was unable to fly on the same day. This delay resulted in adverse feelings against my professional profile and financial loss, as I was unable to perform in a Force Majeure case as scheduled and my client was not properly represented. Having said the above in accordance with the Fare Conditions upon buying I am entitled to a full refund of my ticket. If this is not acceptable please provide me with the relevant reasoning.
