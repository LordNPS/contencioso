			ntd se foi mau tempo	Silvia Rusu Stefania	3			silvia_rusu11@yahoo.com		wizz air	YCG7VD	2016/09/23	barcelona	cluj napoca	3h			because of bad weather all planes had to fligh from one place - a big queue was done and we were finally allowed to fligh the plane was out of fuel so we needed to go back and fuel and get back in line. in total we stayed for 5 hours in the plane, one hour after the announcement was made that the flight was cancelled because they didn't have enough buses. we got a flight the next day at 14:00 no accomodation and were left in the airport without any explanation or excuse. all employees that were there couldn't give us any complete information. We received some meal vouchers, 12 euro each but before we could actually use them we needed to have another long discussion as they were dated a day before and the restaurants wouldn't take them. the flight was suppose to start on the 23rd of sept at 20:00 o'cklock, instead we left on the 24th of sept at 14:00. my father is diabatic, and had his insuline in the big baggadge as the needels are not allowed on the plane. the 5 hours that we waited in the plane could have been very dangerous for him, especially since they didn't have any proper food on the plane and also, at some point closed the bar completely. it was an exhausting experince and the worst part is thta nowbody could give us any clear information at any time.				03Oct 16h10

After one hour they were boarding, but then reaslised that the plane is still not working. After they fixed it (2 hrs) the crew was not allowed to fly anymore and we had to wait for another one that was coming from Madrid. So we had a delay of more then 4 hours when we arrived in Luton. We were only offered drinks at the beginning in the plane. No meal or phone calls were offered. I already tried to contact the airline to ask for compensation, but they are not really answering.				03Oct 09h35		3 Out	jc	SR_Number: 1-7400038436

RyanAir	FR3959	2016-09-16	Bucharest, Otopeni Airport	Rome (Ciampino)	3h		SUISMH	I had a flight from Bucharest (Otopeni airport) to Rome (Ciampino) on September 16th at 21:50. Unfortunately, there was a delay but not with one-two hours, but with three in the very beginning. Afterwards, there was another delay of the same flight, so basically the boarding started at 2 a.m. on September 17th. That's more than 3 hours. I had a business meeting in the morning, so there was a person waiting for me at the airport for many hours. I had also take a taxi which is way more expensive than shuttle bus. Waiting 5 hours at the airport forced me to spend some cash for foor and drinks. It's true RyanAir team tried to provide some sandwiches but they were the most disgusting ones. I don't usually complain about food but they were supposed to organize a bit of more descent food at least.

I had to ask several times I I was done because the security people simply walked away from me without a word. Later that day a woman left the security area under the belief that she was finished. The security folks claimed she had not finished and had somehow fled the security area early. In reality the Frankfurt security staff was very poor about how they communicated to passengers as to what to do and when they were finished. They closed down the airport to search for her and this caused all the planes to be delayed 5 hours. WOW airlines finally got us to Keflavik but we had missed the connecting flights. WOW was very disorganized and they were massively unclear and caused much confusion with the following areas; 1) how to get routed to the buses that would take us to the hotel 2) where we would be staying (in Keflavik or Reykjavik?) 3) how to get our food at the restaurant they took us to for dinner 4) Whether and where Breakfast and lunches were arranged 5) When buses would be taking us from the hotel to the airport. It was a terrible experience where I constantly had to ask about everything and no one was very communicative or well informed. I think the hotel accommodations were unacceptable in that I had to share a bathroom with other guests and it was not in Reykjavik where I could have at least done some sightseeing. I missed a day of work (and the pay associated with it) and had difficulties with pick-up arrangements from the airport in San Francisco.				22Sep 21h45

Sono un Senator *, in viaggio x lavoro, tanto e' vero che sono in un altro viaggio intercontinenta le , oggi, ed ovviamente con Lufthansa. La mia prima scelta, fino ad ora. Il 15 Settembre e' stato cancellato il volo Firenze-Francoforte LH 0313 per maltempo, forse nebbia. Un caos incredibile, disorganizzazione assoluta nella gestione, personale lufthansa che informava in un modo, altro che smentiva. Una volta ufficializzata la cancellazione mi e' stata proposta una nuova rotta x raggiungere Minsk, non piu' via Francoforte, ma volo x Monaco, EN 8197, a seguire x Mosca e dopo Minsk. Carte di imbarco in mano e bagagli diretti alla destinazione finale mi incammino in una avventura che a definirsi disastrosa e' solamente riduttivo. Personale lufthansa a Monaco controlla le mie carte di imbarco e mi assicura che non ci sono problemi x il transito a Mosca vista la coincidenza delle 5:00 am del volo x Minsk e bagagli gia' inviati a destinazione.

Sono un Senator *, in viaggio x lavoro, tanto e' vero che sono in un altro viaggio intercontinenta le , oggi, ed ovviamente con Lufthansa. La mia prima scelta, fino ad ora. Il 15 Settembre e' stato cancellato il volo Firenze-Francoforte LH 0313 per maltempo, forse nebbia. Un caos incredibile, disorganizzazione assoluta nella gestione, personale lufthansa che informava in un modo, altro che smentiva. Una volta ufficializzata la cancellazione mi e' stata proposta una nuova rotta x raggiungere Minsk, non piu' via Francoforte, ma volo x Monaco, EN 8197, a seguire x Mosca e dopo Minsk. Carte di imbarco in mano e bagagli diretti alla destinazione finale mi incammino in una avventura che a definirsi disastrosa e' solamente riduttivo. Personale lufthansa a Monaco controlla le mie carte di imbarco e mi assicura che non ci sono problemi x il transito a Mosca vista la coincidenza delle 5:00 am del volo x Minsk e bagagli gia' inviati a destinazione. Arrivato a Mosca vengo bloccato e trattato nei peggiori modi x la mancanza del visto. Ho passato tutta la notte li ad aspettare per poi volare a Vienna, OS 0606 e nuovamente coincidenza per Minsk, OS 0687.

We waited for further information. There was no Air Serbia representative to solve the issues. I told airport staff I have a connecting flight from Belgrade. They said therebis another flight at 6:00pm. When we arrive in Belgrade at 2:30pm (time i was supposed to be already home/in Bucharest), Air Serbia booked me on flight JU 646, to arrive in Bucharest 3 a.m next day. I asked for a different solution and they say there is no other solution. Then they agreed to check and proposed via Vienna or Via Berlin, but then said it was too late to crch those flights. This should have been discussed and solved in Ljubljana as there were flights to Vienna from there and from Vienna to Bucharest as well. Air Serbia did not care about the passangers and what was next after arriving in Belgrade.				21Sep 14h21		29 Set	jc

This caused small delay and discomfort. After checking in, all was fine, and pilot already said there could be problem for landing to SPU airport due to bad weather but headed to Split anyway. After 2 tries, he continued taxing in air for next 1.45 minutes over area, or more (instead of landing at closest airport Zadar, only 1.5 hours away by car from Split). After 1.45 minutes taxing over area, he decided to go to Zagreb (4 hours = 400 km distance). Then they kept us in plain for one hour more (against our will) waiting to get instructions from management. They didn't wanted to let us out in Zagreb. Toilets were occupied all time, plane was full, air was used, and people started to be quite nervous. After one hour waiting (approximately around 23.00h) captain informed us they will go again in Split, unsure about weather conditions, try to land again, and if landing is not successful they will return us back in MILANO ITALY. After 5 minutes he announced change of plans, saying that they will go back to UK if landing is not successful. Since this was completely out of question for our family (my kids were having school in the morning), we decided to leave the plane immediately, and to call local authorities if needed, since staff didn't wanted to let us out. After some time trying to convince us to stay, we told them we will call police, since in Croatia they are not allowed to keep us against our will to stay. We decided to definitely disembark in Zagreb and to seek public transportation to return back home. We couldnt take risk to go back in UK or in Milano ITALY, especially since there are much closer airports here. At the end, they didn't wanted to let us out before finding our baggage, not willing to transport them to Split (although we paid a ticket for this!), and it took us another precious one hour. They even stayed physically in-front of open doors, just that we cannot go out! Finally they have found our luggage already after midnight so we spent more than 6 hours in plane instead of 2- 2,5h. Since it was too late for arranging public transportation, we took a cab, and it costed us 450 EUR!				19Sep 19h03		30 Set	jc

The delay was more than one day and i lost two day work because i was supposed to guide tourists around Iceland. The airline did not offer to refund anything and how the passengers all had much problem and a hard time to get to Iceland. Expenses are about 100 Euro covering four taxis and food until i came to Iceland.	no notice or less than 3 days before	First the airline tried to put me on another plane the morning after so i had to be at the airport 6:30 but the ticket was a jump ticket and there were no seats available so i had to go back to the ticket office to get another ticket home. Then the airline got me on a plane to Amsterdam (14:30) and from there late next night (22:35)from Amsterdam to Keflavik. I could not get back until more than 1 day after i was supposed to be back. They got me a hotel room at the holiday inn and a voucher for food there but it was so late that the kitchen was closed and nothing to eat but old pasta and i only got one voucher that the hotel took when i ate the pasta so there was no food the day after. The airline did not pay for the taxi to and from the hotel and there were four trips to and from the hotel. They said that the captain got sick so they canceled all the flights to Iceland the whole weekend, i find that strange that they do not get another captain to take the rest of the flights.		02Sep 15h02

We did not accept this but were rudely treated and told this was our only option by the lady behind the Air Berlin ticket desk. They blamed Air Berlin and said only being an Air Berlin station, so they could not do anything for us. Since next to us check-in had started for an Air Berlin flight to Berlin instead, we demand ed to be put on the \\\'\\\'no show\\\'\\\' list for that flight instead. After a lot of persuasion, 1,5 hours of our time and absolute lack of help of Air Berlin the attendents finally rebooked us to the flight to Berlin with transfer to Dusseldorf with lots of complaining. We received two 7 USD food vouchers after having asked for a compensation repeatedly that the staff initially did not want to provide us with. We were treated like animals, not informed of our rights and not informed properly or asked preference with what trip to fly to alternatively. The reason for cancellation of the flight was a mechanical defect of the plane they said. Also the flight was displayed as \\\'\\\'on time\\\'\\\' up until initial departure time as if the flight was not cancelled at all.		29Aug 20h06		1 Set		V1477246 / cli rejeita vaucher - nova introdução de pedido no site: V1488902									8/9		1200		ou voucher 1500- cli recusou

Not even a blanket of any sort. I informed multiple times that my sister was ill and could not remain on a cold seat in the early morning for six hours, but this came to nothing. The only \'compensation\' that we were given, during the whole delay, was a â‚¬5 voucher which was not enough to cover \'breakfast\', since only a coffee and a pastry were over â‚ ¬7. Additionally, everybody was told that they would receive this voucher every two hours, but this did not happen; and when the second voucher was called, not many people heard, then when had asked about it we were told it was too late to redeem this second voucher. The communication between members of the management team at Ryanair was dreadful! Moreover, it is beyond me that it is possible to make such catastrophic mistakes from a leading airline service as to forget about a flight departing at 5:50 am. I had to miss work scheduled today on account of this delay also with very short notice.				27Aug 19h20		18 Set	jc	TID 3009404		Customer Service Reference Number: 1250940

5767		Fe	2x400	Susana Regadas	2		ok	a.regadas@sapo.pt	regadas56@gmail.com carla.pt@gmail.com	Everjets	EVJ917	2016/08/16	Malta	Porto	3h			Venho por este meio apresentar reclamaÃ§Ã£o atinente ao atraso (significativo) no voo EVJ917/117, proveniente de Malta com destino a Lisboa/Porto, no dia 16 de Agosto de 2016, cuja hora prevista de chegada (hora local)- 17.25h. Em nenhum momento deste processo foi apresentada quaisquer justificaÃ§Ã£o ou informaÃ§Ã£o concernente ao atraso verificado. O referido voo foi adiado sucessivamente desde as 17h25m (hora inicialmente prevista) atÃ© Ã s 23h30m, hora de embarque no Aeroporto de Malta. Para operacionalizar esta exposiÃ§Ã£o de forma concisa, precisa e sucinta, passo a elencar alguns factos que considero deveras prementes para uma anÃ¡lise cuidada e assertiva. Adquiri um pacote de fÃ©rias, no qual estavam incluÃ­dos quer as viagens de ida (09/08) e regresso (16/08), (Porto/Malta/Porto, com escala em Lisboa), em regime de TI (tudo incluÃ­do), num Hotel de 4 estrelas, em que os transferes de e para o aeroporto tambÃ©m estavam contemplados. No dia de chegada a Malta, o representante local da Sonhando (da Oswald Arrigo Limited Travel & Tourism), informou-nos da hora de saÃ­da do hotel para o aeroporto no dia de regresso a Portugal (16/08) que se iria observar Ã s 14h 40. No referido dia aguardei com o meu marido no lobby do hotel durante mais de uma hora, sem termos sido contactados por nenhum profissional da equipa do Operador TurÃ­stico Sonhando. Contudo e jÃ¡ perto das 16h00 e atravÃ©s de outros passageiros portugueses que tambÃ©m se encontravam hospedados na mesma unidade hoteleira e que fariam o mesmo voo de regresso, tivemos conhecimento que o transfer foi alterado para as 16.40h, pois o voo estava atrasado. Esse horÃ¡rio tambÃ©m nÃ£o foi cumprido e o transporte sÃ³ se verificou com mais de 30 minutos de atraso. Acresce que, com todas estas alteraÃ§Ãµes permanecemos no mesmo local durante todo esse tempo com receio de perdermos o transfer. O condutor do autocarro que realizou o transporte deixou-nos na entrada do aeroporto sem apresentar qualquer informaÃ§Ã£o adicional. No aeroporto existia a indicaÃ§Ã£o de \"delay\" do voo, sem balcÃ£o para check-in identificado e sem gate de embarque. Aguardamos na Ã¡rea pÃºblica e de restauraÃ§Ã£o, atentos aos quadros que em nenhum momento sofreram alteraÃ§Ãµes. em determinado momento, um elemento de uma famÃ­lia que aguardava no mesmo local, informou-nos que jÃ¡ tinham efectuado o check-in e que o balcÃ£o jÃ¡ havia encerrado. DeslocÃ¡mo-nos entÃ£o ao guichÃ© de informaÃ§Ãµes, que nos indicaram um outro balcÃ£o para o efeito onde jÃ¡ aguardavam outros Portugueses ( 2 deles com viagens adquiridas e cujos nomes nÃ£o se encontravam na lista de passageiros). Quando foi possÃ­vel efectuar o check-in, jÃ¡ nÃ£o haviam lugares contÃ­guos no voo, pelo que tive de vir sentada em lugar que distava do meu marido. Questionada a profissional do dito balcÃ£o nÃ£o soube apresentar mais informaÃ§Ãµes, a nÃ£o ser a constataÃ§Ã£o mais uma vez que o voo se encontrava atrasado. A partir desse momento nos placards foi sendo apenas postada a informaÃ§Ã£o de que o voo estava atrasado e as horas prevista de descolagem de Malta. Inicialmente para as 20h00, depois para as 21h00 e finalmente para as 23h30. A ausÃªncia de informaÃ§Ã£o foi uma constante, mesmo quando solicitada junto dos balcÃµes das informaÃ§Ãµes e apoio ao cliente. Continuavam a constatar o Ã³bvio- o atraso, sendo que acabamos por embarcar e depois levantar voo cerca das 23h 45 minutos. A hora prevista de chegada ao Porto (21h15) acabou por ser consideravelmente mais tardia (3h26). De notar tambÃ©m que dado o horÃ¡rio adiantado, o tempo de recolha de bagagens tambÃ©m foi aumentado e justificado pelos profissionais do aeroporto, pelo nÃºmero mais reduzido de profissionais para essa actividade. Esta situaÃ§Ã£o acarretou para alÃ©m de todo o desconforto e inseguranÃ§a jÃ¡ sentidos em Malta, um sentimento de total desinteresse pelos clientes, visto que na chegada ao aeroporto, nÃ£o se encontrava nenhum elemento da equipa com quem subscrevemos o referido pacote de viagem, que pudesse colmatar pelo menos do ponto de vista da justificaÃ§Ã£o/informaÃ§Ã£o do atraso observado. Para agravamento da situaÃ§Ã£o, o transporte para o respectivo domicÃ­lio tambÃ©m foi constrangedor, visto que o plano delineado na programaÃ§Ã£o das fÃ©rias teve que ser obrigatoriamente redefinido. Como nÃ£o possuÃ­amos transporte pessoal e no exterior nÃ£o existiam TÃ¡xis disponÃ­veis, tivemos que solicitar um tÃ¡xi pelo qual ainda aguardamos algum tempo. Chegamos a casa (PaÃ§os de Ferreira) jÃ¡ muito perto das 5h do dia 17/08/2016.				27Aug 02h06

Ryanair	FR8086	2016/08/10	Riga	Brussels	canc		NNKHHZ	First, I was waiting for boarding in the gate (all passengers were waiting), then followed the message by the microphone, that flight is delayed by some tchnical problems, and there wasn\'t any plane waiting for us. Message about delay was repeated approx. for 3 times every ~20min. I can be wrong about timing, but it was repeated at least 2 times, I think 3times. Finally, around 9-9.10pm, buy the microphone of the airport, we heard the message that flight is cancelled and all passengers have to go to Ryanair cash desk to change the tickets or something like that. In the cash desk there wasn\'t Ryanair crew, but the stuff of Riga airport, who didn\'t tell why flight is cancelled, they didn\'t offer any hotel, to drink or eat, or any other rights from EU261, they told about possible tickets for next flights,and first flight without stops they offered on 22th august, or on 19th august from Vilnius where I had to go by myself, but I was flying with my little kid (born 01.02.2014) and I had to be at work on 16th august in Brussells, so I bought (with perspective that Ryanair will pay me compensation) new tickets from airbaltic to 14th august for 480eur + 40eur they took for buggies of my kid, total 520eur. The news was writing that problem was with Riga airport, but how it\'s my fault...I had to go to work on 16.08.2016. Rayanair didn\'t realise any of passengers rights at the airport by EU261, and first of all, there wasn\'t Ryanair stuff at the airport, Riga airport stuff was answering passenger\'s questions and of course they couldn\'t make some promisses from Ryanair. So we spent on airport 5hours for hearing, in the end, formal answers from Riga airport stuff. We left the airport without a nswers and real help.	no notice or less than 3 days before	I don\\\'t know the number of flights, but Riga airport stuff told me about possible tickets for next possible flights without stops (as I asked for flight without stops because I was flying with my 2years old kid), and first flight from Riga they offered on 22th august, or on 19th august from Vilnius, Lithuania, where I had to go by myself, by car or by bus, but as I wrote, I was flying with my kid, I didn\\\'t want to go to Vilnius. Anyway it would be too late for me, because I had to be at work on 16th august in Brussels, so I bought (with perspective that Ryanair will pay me compensation) new tickets on internet from airbaltic to 14th august.		20Aug 14h25		27 Set	jc	Customer Service Reference Number: 1262283

SATA International	S4152	2016/08/17	Horta	Lisbon	canc		7UM3PW	O cancelamento do voo e o tratamento inadequado dos passageiros foi um grande transtorno para mim, especialmente por estar em trÃ¢nsito e jÃ¡ ter iniciado a viagem hÃ¡ vÃ¡rias horas. NÃ£o consegui apurar esta informaÃ§Ã£o no liveatc.net, mas Ã© possÃ­vel que o comandante do aviÃ£o que nÃ£o aterrou na Horta tenha recusado a hipÃ³tese de divergir o aviÃ£o para o Pico em vez da Terceira.	no notice or less than 3 days before	A minha viagem fazia a ligaÃ§Ã£o SÃ£o Jorge-Lisboa, com escala em Ponta Delgada (incluindo paragem tÃ©cnica na Terceira) e depois na Horta. Este Ãºltimo percurso estava com partida prevista Ã s 17h45 e chegada a Lisboa Ã s 21:10 do dia 17 de Agosto 2016. ReferÃªncia da reserva: 7UM3PW. O aviÃ£o que iria fazer o percurso Horta-Lisboa nÃ£o aterrou e divergiu para a ilha Terceira, alegadamente por mÃ¡s condiÃ§Ãµes climatÃ©ricas, embora estivessem a ser operados voos da SATA Air AÃ§ores na mesma altura no aeroporto da Horta. ApÃ³s ~2h55 de espera com anÃºncios de atrasos, anunciaram finalmente por altifalante o cancelamento do voo. Durante esse perÃ­odo, nÃ£o foram servidas refeiÃ§Ãµes/bebidas aos passageiros que estavam no aeroporto Ã espera. Uma vez que o reencaminhamento implicou a pernoita na Horta, deveria ter-me sido providenciado alojamento pela companhia aÃ©rea. Contudo, os colaboradores da SATA informaram-nos de que nÃ£o havia alojamento disponÃ­vel para todos os passageiros. Por esse motivo, tive de recorrer a familiares para pernoitar na casa deles. Esta e outras situaÃ§Ãµes relacionadas com o cancelamento foram notÃ­cia: http://www.rtp.pt/play/p56/e247127/telejornal-acores (vide minutos 06:13-13:20). A companhia ofereceu-me as viagens de tÃ¡xi de ida/volta entre o aeroporto e a casa particular onde pernoitei. O voucher que me ofereceram para o jantar no dia 17 nÃ£o foi utilizado porque (i) o restaurante do aeroporto jÃ¡ estava fechado e (ii) nÃ£o hÃ¡ restaurantes nas redondezas da casa onde pernoitei, ficando essa refeiÃ§Ã£o a cargo da minha famÃ­lia. Depois de assistir Ã reportagem com o porta-voz da SATA, fiquei entÃ£o a saber que a falta de certificaÃ§Ã£o dos pilotos para aterrar na Horta Ã noite foi tambÃ©m motivo para o cancelamento do voo, uma circunstÃ¢ncia que entendo nÃ£o ser extraordinÃ¡ria/alheia Ã companhia aÃ©rea. TambÃ©m entendo que nÃ£o foram tomadas todas as medidas razoÃ¡veis nesta situaÃ§Ã£o, nomeadamente: encaminhamento dos passageiros que iam fazer a ligaÃ§Ã£o Horta-Lisboa para a Terceira pela SATA Air AÃ§ores, para entÃ£o apanharem o voo da SATA International para Lisboa; ou divergÃªncia do aviÃ£o para o Pico em vez da Terceira, sendo os passageiros transportados da Horta para essa ilha vizinha por via marÃ­tima para entÃ£o apanharem o voo para Lisboa, como jÃ¡ sucedera noutras ocasiÃµes. A partida da Horta para Lisboa aconteceu finalmente no dia 18 de Agosto no voo S43150 Ã s 13:34 em vez das 11:50, com chegada Ã s 16:35 em vez das 15:15.		19Aug 23h45		2 Set	jc	1190753

The flight was supposed to depart from Chania Airport to Paphos Airport at 23:05, but was delayed by over 13 hours. We were informed at around 21:30 that there would be about an hour delay and so at 00:30 we were boarded onto the aeroplane. Instead of us departing from the airport we were driven around the airport in the aeroplane until 01:30 a.m. where it was announced to us that there was a technical problem and the flight would be postponed for another 20 minutes. However, they could not fly us out as the pilots had already done their shift and we were told we had to wait in the airport till further notice. After couple of hours somebody finally came to inform us that we need to stay at the airport or go and stay somewhere else, if we have a place to go because our flight was scheduled for Sunday, 11:30a.m. Again with another delay we eventually boarded at 12:15 noon. There was no special care or concern about any of the passengers, we were just left at the gate till boarding time. There were no blankets provided to us since it was extremely cold at the gate we were left, only refreshment vouchers for very little drinks and only snacks were allowed-, no proper meal.. We shouldâ€™ve been offered accommodation till our next given flight or offered at least somewhere to freshen up. We were left unsatisfied and extremely upset inside the gate of the airport and extremely worried concerned when we would arrive safely back home. We believe that we are entitled to compensation Under The Terms and Conditions of EU Regulation 261/2004. We look forward to receiving our compensation approval as soon as this case has been looked into.

My flight to Riga should be on time 13:10, gates closing around 12:40 so I had plenty of time for coffee and last phone conversations. Around 12:00 I started to move to tables where is luggage checking in. And lady at desk said that my flight is delayed till 16:30, when I asked why she said that she dont know and I can get food vaucher on 3Â£. Luton airport is so expensive that there is nothing to buy for 3Â£. So I took vaucher and sat on bench next to telly and started to wait for 16:30. Around 16:35 gates was open and I went to the gates. Borded around 17:00 and plane left at 17:30. In Riga I was at 22:00 and I missed bus to my hometown, which is 230 km from Riga. Last bus to my hometown leaves Riga at 17 :10. If flight would be on time I could get last bus and get to home normaly like I always do. But this time there were no buses and I was in a middle of airport with no chances to get home. I gave call to one of my friends and he arrieved to airport to pick me up. He collected me around 1:00 and at home I was at 4:00. If flight would be on time I would be at home at 21:00. So I spent 7 hours in airport with no food and drink and another hour to get on plane and leave airport. Plus to that I had problems to get home cos like I said I missed last bus to my home and I needed another 6 hours to get there instead of 3 hours If I would go by bus.				18Aug 12h44		18 Ago	jc	REFERENCE ID IS:9EC0C9C3

We were on the flight from Chania to Paphos and our discomfort was very big. Initially the flight was at 11.05 the night of Saturday, at 9.30 night they told us that we will have an 1 hour delay.At 12.30 we borded on the plane and taking us rounds in the airport with the airplane until 1.30 morning without explain any reasons. After an hour announced that there is a technical problem and the flight was postponed to the next day with an unknown time and they were told that the plane would be ready in 20 minutes but could not get them because the pilots\' SUPPLEMENTED \"their hours and had to come another crew from other country. They came the next day the crew at 11.30 and had to leave eventually fled 11.30 o\'clock , finally they left from Chania at 12.15 morning to Paphos from Chania. They did not give nor blankets were inside the airport gate in squalid conditions. After all those happened at the airport we came to Paphos with flue and until now both of us, me and my wife we are under treatment and we spend a lot of money for care. Hurray compensation from your company would otherwise i will move to legal way.Thanks Regards Christos Andreou				17Aug 17h55		23 Set	jc

The flight was delayed for more than 15 hours. The problem was not based on exceptional circumstances or act of god. We have an information that the flights was delayed due the strong wind. You can find a time table from 7th September from Dubrovnik airport that the plane to Hanover landed and departed the same night and almost at the same time as the flight to Amsterdam is planed. We spent the night at the airport, we missed the day at work, we only got the juice and sandwiches, but we didn\'t get the water and the bottle of 0.5l at Dubrovnik airport cost 3 euro, Due to the delay of 15 hours and the air distance between the airports we have the right to be compensated by 250 euro for each passenger.				17Aug 16h24

The way of the airport and back is ca. 300â‚¬. - I bought the tickets for my children, Amra Visnjic, Ermin Visnjic and myself Hankusa Visnjic, with the number: W6420/140816/BEG-MMX.
The date of the flight back then was the 14 of august 2016. Your airline (Wizzair) sold the already bought ticket of my son, Ermin Visnjic, twice and for that reason he could not fly on that day. Since my son is only seven years old, i could not possibly let him left behind alone. The people from Wizzair advised me to rent a hotel room until the 17 of august 2016 (the date of the next flight, number: W64209/170816/BEG_MMX) and pay it with my own money. Since i was at the end of my vacation i spend most of my money and had none to pay for a hotel room.
For that reason i had to spend the next three days in my parents house,which to even get there i had to take a taxi and even borrow money from them.			I\\\'m am not arrived to sweden because the company WIZZ had made a mistake. I had became a ticket witch is sold. Because of your mistake i lost 3 days of work and a risk to lose my job. I don\\\'t want a hotel because of the money I don\\\'t have enought monay to live 3 day in a hotel. I was traveld back to my parentd home witch is 350 km far and I had loaned monay for the travel back to home and to the airport back. The receip for the travel expenses can I optionally deliver later. The trsvel expenses were ca. 300â‚¬. Hankusa Visnjic	16Aug 09h39

We arrived 3 hours earlier at the airport to make sure everything will be smooth. Upon check-in, I noticed that they have written on the screen \"ETA 1:00, Aug 1\" and asked them to correct it, because we are flying on the 31st of July. To my horror, they told me that the flight will be delayed by more than 9 hours. I asked for an explanation and they told me that this delay was accumulated over the course of a few days and they were not able to catch up. So they knew that there will be a huge delay but could not be bothered to inform us by email in advance (they do have all email addresses of passengers who bought tickets online via their web site). No passenger at the baggage dropoff queue seemed to know in advance that there will be a delay! As a result, we were forced to be stranded at the airport for 9 hours. It was a miserable experience. There were sick children vomiting all over the gate. People sleeping on the floor. The airline provided food and drinks as required by law. However, they refused to provide the most important thing we need: INFORMATION. All they said was that we are waiting for an aircraft to arrive from PRG. I challenged them multiple times and they couldn\'t answer my simple question: has the aircraft left the PRG airport - yes or no? (With some research I found that the aircraft we are waiting for is in fact QS 1178). At this point we thought that they are trying to cover up something very serious. I discovered at least 3 flights to PRG operated by the same airline. They all departed to PRG while we were stranded. Information desk confirmed seat availability. I immediately challenged representatives and demanded to be transferred to these flights free of charge. Their responses: \"These are charter flights, we are not allowed to transfer you to charters\" \"You need to buy tickets, your baggage to be transferred, it\'s a lot of work\". Nonsense. The estimated time of departure moved from 01:00 to 02:00 and when the deadline was missed once again - to 04:00. We departed at 04:30 am in what most of us perceived as a miracle. Precisely 12 hours after the regular time (16:30). Inside the cabin the pilot announced that the delay was caused by a technical operational problem.				02Aug 08h19		3 Ago	jc	2 out resend

After one week stay she was heading home but her flight was deleied. She is 79 year old and has bad health (speaks no english or other comon language). Her name is Ieva Sniegute Jankauskiene. Original flight time was 15:25. First time delay was made to 23:30 then to 01:00 (july 31) and then again to 06:00 (july 31). Then I asked wow air to asist her with resting place ( loges or the hotel) they told that all was occupied and they didn\'t show any will to help to elderly person. When I writing this I still don\'t know if 06:00 estimated time will not change again. Also she missed transport from airport in Vilnius, Lithuania. I still will have to sort it out how she can get back home...I hope you could h elp me to repay my mother this hard trip experiance. Well money is not important is just I hope her health will be ok after this nonsense.				31Jul 02h47		3 Ago	jc	252112977

AirPort Nikola Tesla	Malmo Sweden	3h		W91C2J 17jul/AB2RMQ 22jul	TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: Ticket claim I have purchased two tickets to Malmo for Sunday 17.7. but the flight was delayed and I got the following SMS message at the airport : Your Wizz Air flight under W91C2J reservation code is expected to be delayed. We\'re doing our best to minimize the inconvenience. We\'ll keep you updated. Wizz Air 4209 BEG-MMX flight\'s new estimated time of departure: 10:35, 2016.07.18. Please check airport displays for further info. In the meantime, at the Wizz Air airport office I got info that I can purchase a new return tickets via website as an exchange for this delayed flight, which I did, and the new date on tickets was Friday July 22nd, costing me in total 1,615 SEK. Not long after I have purchased new tickets I received info at the airport that our Sunday flight will be delayed for Monday morning and cost of overnight, taxes etc. will be covered by WizzAir, with no option of exchanging ticket for a new date (flight). The reason for my claim is unnecessary cost occurred for a new tickets (total 1,615 SEK), and were purchased because of wrong info given to us at the airport. Also, I have occurred cost of airport transfer (5,600 DIN) and cost of overnight (another 5,000 DIN) along with one day at work I have missed due to this delay (1,000 SEK). So total cost caused of flight delay and wrong info given to us at the airport is following: New ticket purchased or no reason- 1,615 SEK Airport transfer (to and from airport)- 5,600 DIN Overnight - 5,000DIN Day at work missed- 1,000 SEK Sincerely, Vesna Mihailovic Hadzic Elvira				29Jul 16h22		13 Ago	jc	71dff6be - 02 - 0100

Due to the delay, the connection in Vienna for the flight OS791 has been missed. As a consequence of this, we have been re-booked to the flight OS787 at 17:35 arriving to the destination at 20:14. The meal compensation for this almost entire day was 7.5 EUR/person. Due to the fact we spend all the day in the airports and in the planes and our healthy has been deteriorated during the day we are asking damages of 500 EUR/persons.

We were already at the airport and were told that our new flight would leave the following morning. Because of this delay we missed an event we had already paid for and also a train we had already booked from Nice to Marseille. In addition we had to book a new train after we landed (our hotel was in Marseille). Other added expenses are accomodation in ReykjavÃ­k while waiting for the new flight and meals. I did issue a complaint using their complaint form, number of complaint is V1429309. They offered compensation in the form of a 400 euro discount on my next booking with them. I don\'t feel that a discount is an acceptable compensation and have tried to voice my unhappiness, but haven\'t received any response.	no notice or less than 3 days before	Yes, they booked us a flight with another carrier the following morning.

But i do not know their names	iberia	IB3118	2016-04-21	madrid	lisbon	deny			There was free rerouting next day			Dear Madam/Sir, I write to you to inform you on the following incident: My daughter and I were traveling with Iberia from Athens to Lisbon via Madrid on the 21th April 2016. In Madrid we were denied boarding although we were holding a confirmed reservation and boarding pass, we presented ourselves well in advance before boarding time, we had proper travel documentation and there was not any health/safety/security issue involved. The information we received from Iberia desk in Madridâ€™s airport was that â€œwe did not appear in travelers lists due to a possible computer error in the web system of the companyâ€ (sic). We were offered accommodation, meals and free transportation to and from the hotel and we were boarded in a Madrid â€ Lisbon flight next day (22 April 2016). We filled (me and my daughter) the EU complain form along with photocopied boarding passes and we sent it to the legal department of Iberia on the 28th/04/2016. Iberia emailed us on 31th/05/2016 (Reference: C16051-3421740535) asking us to provide further documents, a request with which we timely complied. Next, Iberia emailed us again on the 24th/06/2016 with the following content: â€œI am writing in relation to flight IB 3118 of 21, April 2016 and would like to take this opportunity to thank you for contacting us. Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience we might have caused you due to the flight delay (IB3151 from Athenas to Madrid). We know how important it is to our passengers that the scheduled time is observed on a trip, and make every effort to achieve this. On this occasion, we were forced to delay the flight due to a fault that our technicians had to repair to ensure the safety of your flight. As it was an extraordinary circumstance that we could not prevent, despite taking all the measures at our disposal, European Community Regulations do not establish any compensationâ€. I am not satisfied with iberiaâ€™s answer since there was never any flight delay (IB31 51 from Athenas to Madrid (21 April 2016) as claimed in iberiaâ€™s mail, neither have we mentioned one in our complain form. Iberiaâ€™s argument is false/imprecise as you can verify checking on the records of either VENIZELOS airport or BARAJAS airport regarding the specific flights on this date. There was no missed connection due to a delay, neither have we claimed one. There was a denied boarding against our will and without any responsibility from our side, as described in the complain form. Iberia failed to provide any argument on the denial of boarding in the IB3118 flight from Madrid to Lisbon, which is the real incident.	18Jul 06h48		19 Jul	jc	Reclamación cliente_20160719090014612

On the other hand, i'm not sure what arrival time means. Is it the time when a plane touch a runway in the destination or when a plane stops at a dock and a pilot says parking position?...anyway i'm a platinum member of AB for 3 years, so i guess AB could more friendly to me and to this claim.

We then proceeded to check-in and get onto the plane, after we were on the plane they told us that there system of scanning boarding passes had failed and that they had 2 extra passengers on board, after multiple head counts and checking each individuals boarding pass they had sorted out the problem after about an hour and a half.

As I'm a Miles & More Senator, I asked the lounge to be re-booked on another flight. They refuse. I went to the ticket counter where I found more than 20mt of people waiting. After half an hour I decided to call my travel agency and book another flight to Geneva. There I booked a car to come back Turin. I therefore paid an additional ticket (333 â‚¬), lost my original ticket (280â‚¬) and missed all my evening appoinrment. This is in addition of more than 4 hours in the airport as the flight before being cancelled, has been delayed 3 times (one hour each).

I have to say Iâ€˜m disapointed with behavior of Wizzair. I mean there was all in one: and delayed flight time 3 hour and problems during flight time, finally we spend more than 2 hours in the airplain with no condition in absolutely uncertainly in Girona airport (we expected to land in Barcelona terminal 2 airport). So we had no choice because if we would choose to get hotel from airplain your company could not return the suitcases immediately. We feel imprisoned these 2 hours. So I dont speak about expences that occured directly due to the delay by Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 of the European Parliament. I speak about compensation that occurred directly due to my experience. Just because our airplain was arrived not in Barcelona, that is why I have late for one day to my job, and I lost 12 hours work day one of my work hour cost 15 euro( it is not small money for me). ( I have got my destination point about 5 o clock in the morning instead 11-12 in the evening.) Second - yes, I have bought something in airport , when the flights was delayed, but I haven't collect any cheques. And third - in the airplain, after delaying for 3 hours , water was selling to the passengers, instead of giving it for free. (I have got video like an evidence) Wizzair offered me 50 euro on my wizzair balance like a compensation - it is not really satisfied me, that is why I am writing to you, possibly you can help me!?

My baggage arrived three days later damaged.			On Schiphol Airport, AirSerbia's flight Amsterdam-Belgrade-Sofia was delayed with more than hour and a half. AirSerbia staff sent me to a KLM flight Amsterdam-Berlin-Sofia at 12:30h which was also delayed and took off at 13:50h. Due to this delay, I missed my transfer in Berlin which was at 15:15h. I arrived in Berlin at 15:20h. In Berlin, the information desk staff issued me a ticket Berlin-Vienna-Sofia. I took a flight for Vienna at 17:50h and from Vienna I took off for Sofia at 20:25h. I arrived at Sofia at 23:00h local time. With my first flight that I bought Amsterdam-Belgarade-Sofia I should have been in Sofia at 15:25 local time. Moreover, my checked-in baggage (1 suitcase - 23kg) was lost on the way. I found out it had not been sent anywhere from Amsterdam so when I called AirSerbia on Friday, one person from the staff said that he will send it to Sofia on Saturday. On Sunday, I received my baggage in Yambol from the Lost & Found Service Sofia Airport. My suitcase was torn on the inside and one of the feet-wheels was missing. The delivery guy wrote a Report on Damage to the checked baggage but still nobody has contacted me. + email: I did not take the flight to Belgrade. The reason, I suppose was that 
even if I had boarded this flight, I wouldn't have caught the transfer in Belgrade. The delay was said to be due to bad weather conditions. When the delay occured, the AirSerbia staff sent me to 
another flight with another company - KLM. This fligh which was supposed to take off at 12:30 also had a delay and took off at 13:50. Due to this delay I missed my transfer from Berlin to Sofia. This is why in Berlin I went to the information desk. The person there gave me another flight  with another comapny - Austrian Airlines, for Vienna and from Vienna I had to transfer to Sofia. In the end, my baggage was lost and I had to wait for three days to receive it. The suitcase was also broken and torn a little bit on the inside. + The flight number Amsterdam-Berlin was KL 1825. The flight Berlin-Sofia was AB 8280 - this one I did not catch. The flight Berlin-Vienna was OS 0294. And the one Vienna-Sofia OS 0799.	30Jun 23h41		3 Ago	jc	2 out resend

Some other passengers received text messages while i did not get one. Therefore, I have spent over 3 hrs just sitting in the airport. The flight that was supposed to leave at 21:10 only got off the ground at 00:40. This also meant that the lift i had organised myself to get home was not available anymore and I had to use a taxi instead, which ended up being really expensive as I live in another city then Vilnius. Moreover, other flight companies that had delayed their flights in the past have provided the passengers with food vouchers. Well not wizzair - another unplanned meal had to happen in the airport (which is obviously rather priy in such location). Very poor service. I have paid 66.49 GBP for the flight and could not be more disappointed.				28Jun 14h54

Further the plane was smaller than the scheduled plane and there was very limited leg space.				25Jun 16h17	Holanda	F	14Jul	ack email								8 Ago					Rabobank account NL04 RABO 0305 7251 65 which is registered to Maikel Verhoeven and Hanne Hoefs in Uden, the Netherlands.

The flight delayed about 4 hours, and the next flight (booked together with the first) was missed. We had to wait for more 3 hours (minimum) in lines to have rebooked our flight. We also missed a third flight from Madrid to Porto but this one wasnâ€™t booked in the same agency (Ryanair flight). The solutions British Airways/Iberia gave us were: (i) fly the next day directly to Porto (and they wouldnâ€™t pay the expenses of spending the night in London), a flight to Madrid (original destination) at night/late afternoon or a flight to Lisbon also in the same day. We chose the third option in order to minimize the distance from our homes, reduce increased costs originated with the initial delay and to try to avoid missing our jobs the next day as we both had to work early in Porto. Iberia also gave a coupon to have dinner at Londonâ€™s airport of 10 pounds each. Besides the long hours of waiting and the inconvenient, we also had extra costs with spending the night in Lisbon and transportation from Lisbon to Porto the next day and having dinner at JFK airport.				22Jun 21h42		1 Ago	jc	ID is 15577575

During this time we had no information. After several hours they offered us meal vouchers (I didn\'t had the chance to get it; it took them more than 1,2 hours just to print them) After spending the entire day in the airport they announced us that they will assure us a flight during the next day! I explained I have to be there during the next hours not the next day due to some personal business problems - the answer was: NO I have chosen to buy on my own a ticket with another company which had a flight to Bucharest during that evening. It feels just incredible rude the behavior and the waiting time by which the company treated us!		I used the flight from OPT to PRG. Only the one to return (PRG-OTP) was canceled and arranged only for the next morning by TAROM. She has chosen the same option: to pay a flight on her own that goes to Bucharest during the same evening! I don't have the invoice; it was payed by a sponsor company the flight following some personal services.

Meals were offered by the air company. It was a cooperation between Alitalia and Air Bulgaria. We were supposed to fly on 11.06 at 9:30 am so we did check in and started the waiting process on the gate (see fist line of tickets for 3 passengers). The flight was posponed with half an hour for several times, till the final cancelation around noon. We recuperated the lugage and moved to the Alitalia checkin desk in order to understand if there will be an alternative flight in the same day. To be honest Alitalia was not transparent at all and moved the error because of tecnical problems to AirBulgaria, the owner of the air craft. All passengers claimed at Alitalia help desk becuase we all bought the tickets on the Alitalia web page.

Then,nothing was announced,we had to ask personally,and there was nobody who knew something. After midnight they said that the flight was cancelled and that we will get the hotel voucher. We payed taxi but it is supposed that we will get this money back. We came to the room at 4 AM. At 6 AM we got the sms that the flight will be at 22 PM with a new code DY 7904 and that for meal voucher we have to come back to the airport which was one hour and a half from the hotel. The bus to the airport was organized at 17 PM but nobody told us,and there was a lot of people who didnt know that, so we had to pay the transport by ourself back to the airport. They said that the taxi will not be paid cause the bus was organized, even if we did not know that! When we came to the airport there was a big mess! So many people waiting for the check in so it was obvious that we could not do the checkin in time,but they said that everybody will come to the plane! People who had booked the flight for the 6th of June had priority so they did first checkin,even if we have waited already for 24 hours! Our flight had a new code DY 7904 and it was supposed to be at 21.55. We had a delay again, even if it was sunny all day long,they just said that we are waiting for the plane. Finally we got the meal voucher,but we had to ask for it. At the end, the flight was at 1 AM, within 27 hours of delay. I lost all the trains and almost a next flight who i had it from Oslo. We asked if it is possible to go somewhere nearby,cause we saw that there was a plane to Kopenhagen or Oslo but they said that is not possible,that we can get money back for the flight and book a new flight by ourselves.

Due to strike in France on 28th and 29th April, I received a message from Vueling that the Flight is delayed. I had already checkin on the night of 27th however I couldn\'t download my boarding pass. The next morning at the airport about an hour befor the departure time I saw no information against my flight and no one at the check in counters. Assuming that the flight might be delayed I waited for the information to be updated. At 9 am I saw that the boarding has began, I ran at the security to help me print the boading pass since I couldn\'t find the airlines on any of the kiosk and no one at the check in counters. Without any help from the security per sonnel, I rushed to Lufthansas counter to finally locate the small vueling counter where the lady denied to print my boarding pass after repeated request as I was losing time. Eventually I missed my flight with all this confusion about the delay in flight. After sometime a few others turned up who missed their flight due to the same problem. I was supposed to be in Barcelona for the exhibition Alimentaria where I had few meetings. The losses I had to bear due to this bad client experience are: missed flight, missed important meetings, lost time, payed 50 Euros to get the keys at AirBnB as I reached late in the night, payed for the bus tickets, and the grave inconvinience caused to me.				09Jun 01h27		3 Ago	jc	[SR_Number: 1-6887894420]

Our flight was scheduled to leave at 14:15 but didnâ€™t leave until 19:55. The reason for the delay was that their plane had skidded off the Birmingham runway at landing. The only announcement that was made was that there would be â€˜further informationâ€™ at 14:00, then at 14:30 and then at 17:00. We were left guessing whether our flight would actually depart, about the reason for the delay and about any possible action that we would have to take. At 17:20 we found out that we would possibly leave around 19:30. It was only through the published online news that we were informed on the actual reason for the delay: their plane skidded off the runway due to a technical fault. And neither in the airport nor on board of the newly chartered plane did we get an official apology and/or explanation by Monarch! According to that afternoonâ€™s news some passengers on the particular aircraft experienced that there was something wrong on take-off. Yet it was decided to go ahead and continue the flight, after which it nearly crashed and caused a long delay for us and our 18 months daughter. It made us arrive at our final destination at 1:30 am! The replacement plane that was then chartered obviously had a different approach to customer service than to what we are used to from Monarch. We were quite frankly bullied by an obviously tired and overworked cabin manager. She needed to project her tiredness and frustration on a couple with a young kid. We found ourselves at the end of the boarding queue instead of the usual beginning. We were then told off for asking for help from the cabin crew in stowing our hand luggage and were literally commanded to sit down, while the window seat was still expecting another passenger, while that seat and mine were filled with all our hand luggage and while I couldnâ€™t sit down because there were people blocking the aisle. She then made it her â€˜jobâ€™ during the flight to keep checking on everything we did or did not do â€ to such an extend that passengers around us were getting uncomfortable with it and started making comments. Itâ€™s simply passive-aggressive power driven behavi our that shows up when people are experiencing some internal stress â€ as I experience throughout a lot of my work with individuals and organizations. I just donâ€™t expect this from someone being put in charge of a sensitive situation. I already wrote to Monarch when we were back from holiday. They took about 6 months and more of my writing to actually send a response, saying that they are not taking responsibility for the delay (all documents from that communication are still available., should you need them). Back then the new EU compensation law was just being introduced and they just tried to get away with it by bullying and dodging techniques. I just heard from a friend that she finally got compensated, so this is my new try.				06Jun 19h22		17Junho	F	email ack

Please allow me to further explain myself. I checked in on time for the flight through the Emirates application. Eventually I never received a boarding pass. By the time I realized I couldn't go through the check point I directly proceeded to Emirates Desk to confirm my presence at the airport. The lady on duty was anything but helpful although I insisted on presenting my valid ticket and making clear that it was more than necessary for me to fly due to professional commitments dictating my immediate presence in Athens. This is also demonstrated by the fact that I was travelling Business Class, as flights were fully booked due to hijack the day before. Although I arrived timely and evidently by the airport authorities at the Emirates Desk, the members of staff denied picking me up to board. I hereby note my disappointment with regard to Emirates ground personnel service. The company should have evaluated the situation more effectively provided that professional activity of doctors and lawyers is considered a vocation. As already mentioned, flights being fully booked I was unable to fly on the same day. This delay resulted in adverse feelings against my professional profile and financial loss, as I was unable to perform in a Force Majeure case as scheduled and my client was not properly represented. Having said the above in accordance with the Fare Conditions upon buying I am entitled to a full refund of my ticket. If this is not acceptable please provide me with the relevant reasoning. In this case I wish to proceed with reissuing my ticket or reimbursement of the remaining amount after the relevant (no show or revalidation) fee is applied in line with the Fare Conditions. Please, provide me with instructions. Finally, I wish to stress that ground personnel at Emirates desk never informed me with respect to cancellation policy before departure as provided in Fare Conditions.

No reason given why they could not put me on the next Iberia flight from madrid rather than the ridiculous routing to Paris with too short a connection time. Unable to get any service from Iberia at CDG as they do not fly there and weren\'t answering their phones at Orly.			My connecting flight from London on the code share partner BA was late into Madrid. I arrived at the gate in good time but was told I was unable to board as my luggage couldn\\\'t be brought to the flight in time. The next flight to Lagos was 2 days ahead so instead they put me on a flight to Paris CDG the next day with an impossible connection on Air France. I was then left stranded in Paris and had to purchase another ticket back to London and a fresh air ticket on BA to Lagos. Iberia have said they are not liable. I believe they are as they did not complete their contract with me to fly me to Lagos. I have all receipts and ticket stubbs - grateful for advice.	20May 17h43

It doesn't sound that bad now, but the thing is that at the airport there was no one there to inform us about anything. They left us on our own. So we were sitting and waiting without any informations. There should have been someone who keeps us informed about the situation. And same situation in the hotel. Nobody told us anything, juste gave us the room keys and thats all. So most of the people didnt even sleep in the hotel because they didn't know if some other coach is not going to take us back to the airport in next hour or so... So when we arrived to the hotel they should have said to us -listen don't worry about anything, as soon as we'll sort things out we'll let you know.. someone from the reception will call every single room to inform you about the coachor something like that. About 9am they pinned the note on the board in the reception room that the coach will take us to the airport at 11am.

I have bought new clothes and everything just to survive until I will get my luggage back unfortunately I didn’t save any bills.

I have got new ticket but only in evening to travel to Barcelona, it was the flight at 11 pm but it was delayed again and I was in the plain only at 2 am and I was in Barcelona at 4 am (4.04.2016). It was really nightmare as I didn’t sleep almost at all. I was so stressed and unfortunately I have lost my boarding pass from Sevilla to Barcelona. The next flight to Warsaw I had only on 4.04.2016 at 10.35 am (I have boarding pass for it). They proposed me the hotel or food (not and food only they said food or hotel) but It left only 4-5 hours until the next flight to Warsaw so I stayed at the airport.				11abr		13abr	F	1-6021255941

Because I knew there were problems because of the French air controller strike, before going through security I inquired if there were any problems with that flight. An airport ground worker informed me that the flight was no longer visible of the Gatwick internal website, i.e. that it would likely be cancelled. I checked with the vueling desk and was informed that the flight was just delayed but would go ahead. The announced delay was 5 hours, to 2am. At 1.30 am we were informed that the flight was cancelled. I think it is unlikely the flight would have gone ahead, and we were just kept waiting in the airport for no reason.		04Apr 10h55		14abr16	F	1-6027974728

At least 20 passengers were travelling the same route to Montreal(connecting with the same flight in Heathrow). At least half of these passengers were issued with connecting boarding cards. There people made the connection, whereas we had to try check in at flight connections desk, 1hr 2mins prior to gate closing. Neither Aer Lingus or Air Canada flight connections desks would help, even though our colleagues who had made the connecting flight were phoning us from the Aircraft telling us the plane was waiting for us. The only outcome they would entertain was putting us on the same flight the following day, 24hrs later.				2016/03/08 15:23:43

They told me that I would have to wait till check-in opened to the next flight (12 hours later!!) to get any information. Resulting in a 12 hour wait in the airport, with no compensation offered!

Originally my route was from Bangkok, Thailand (Suvarnabhumi Intl Arpt) to Budapest, Hungary (Liszt Ferenc Arpt) with a transfer in Moscow, Russia (Sheremetyevo Arpt.) with a 4 hour transfer. I could not accept the alternative flight because I am 63 years old pensioner with medical issues and this circumstance were not suitable. The airline did not offer any meals or hotel. Since I bought the ticket through an agent (Pelikan.hu) the airline refused to help me and directed back to the agent. Since this case happened on the weekend the agent (Pelikan.hu) was not reachable either by phone or by e-mail. Finally, I decided not to leave Bangkok and I rather bought a new ticket with a normal/acceptable transfer time. 		2016/02/02 12:54:12		11fev																				aeroflot	XX

This was free. It concerns flight FR1919 by Ryanair.
I am currently unable to pay for more accomodation than foreseen and will have to take a tram to the airport twice as much just to settle this issue. (2x €4.90) 
Furthermore am I missing out on my educational priorities due this mishappening.
Neither do I currently have the financial freedom to enjoy my stay until the next flight. (Food, drinks, etc...) thus am I hoping the airline company will fix this as promised in the e-mail. 
If necessary I will provide you with more information as soon as I have spoken to a Ryanair employee.

Perdeu ligação	xavier_1515@hotmail.com		Alitalia	AZ0521	2015/06/28	Sofia (SOF)	Rome (FCO)	Delay 1h fez perder ligação			I had booked a trip Sofia (SOF) - Rome (FCO) - Amsterdam (AMS) on the 28/06/2015, with flights AZ0521 (19:05-20:00) and AZ7716 (21:00-23:25). The first flight was delayed by more than one hour. So, I missed the connection in Rome. The company paid for the hotel and put me on the next flight, i.e. AZ7710, which was leaving the next morning (29/06/2015) at 6h30, and ended up being late as well. So, I arrived in Amsterdam on Monday 29/06/2015 at about 9:00 (am), and arrived too late at work, instead of Sunday 28/06/2015 at 23:25. I asked for a compensation to Alitalia. After waiting for almost 4 months, I finally received a reply from them in which they denied my claim, invoking extraordinary circumstances, which they did not detail. 				2015/11/01 11:38:41		8nov	enviei de novo form preenchido para mail customer.relationsbr@alitalia.it 13/05 F	responderam q trataram com o passageiro -a kem disseram q o voo anterior atrasou por ground operations				8nov													3	alitalia - 8nov -NEB italiano -atraso no voo anterior por ground operations -alitalia diz q tratou com o passageiro -ver se se refere a uma primeira queixa	insisti 21/04 F	tribunal italia ?
